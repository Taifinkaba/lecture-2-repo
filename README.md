# lecture-2-repo

This is lecture number 2.
I made this word **bold**.
## why would we want to have a local version of the repo.
we would want a local repo so our changes aren't global incase we make a mistake.
makes any changes/ fixes/ alterations local so we can test/ play with the code before making it permenant. 
offline updates.
## steps after making any changes to your local repo.
step 1: makee remote git local.
step 2: clone rpo into vs code.
step 3: edit vs code(changes).
step 4a: check status of repo. (git (status/add/./-A))

## free recall:
